# GitUP - GitUpdater

Checks the provided Git repositories for any news either local or on server side

## Usage

First, provide your desired folders where GitUp should look for Git repos. E.g. you can provide something like "C:\User\xxx\projects" but not like "C:\" as the script is intended for running every startup and therefore might slow down you PC a lot if searching takes very long.

You will be prompted on first run of GitUp if you haven't already.

```python
py -3 gitup.py
```

## Disclaimer

As with any open source stuff, I definitely do not guarantee an error-free functionality of the program nor take responsibility for any damage on git repos or other files resulting from the usage of this program.
